# Covid_19 Time Series Analysis

This project applies time series analysis and forecasting techniques to COVID-19 data obtained from [Kaggle’s Coronavirus Report dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report). The dataset covers the first 27 weeks of 2020, capturing the early progression of the pandemic across different countries.

The project explores active cases, recoveries, and deaths over time, and develops a forecasting model to project future case trends. An interactive dashboard was also created to provide a clear and user-friendly interface for exploring the insights.

## Objectives

* Perform exploratory time series analysis on COVID-19 data.
* Visualize pandemic dynamics (active cases, recoveries, deaths).
* Apply forecasting techniques (ARIMA/ETS) to predict future trends.
* Build an interactive dashboard for insights and storytelling.

## Insights

* The first 27 weeks of 2020 captured the initial wave of COVID-19.
* Exponential growth was observed in the early months, followed by slower increases as containment measures were introduced.
* Recovery rates gradually improved, while fatalities highlighted the uneven healthcare capacity across countries.
* Forecasting indicated potential continuation of case growth if interventions were not strengthened.

## Dashboard

The interactive dashboard provides:

* Trends of Active, Recovered, and Death cases
* Forecasted values for upcoming weeks
* Ability to compare across different countries
